# Masters-Project

This project takes tri-axial accelerometer data, collected from I Measure U sensors,<br>
with the end goal to estimate compresive bone force from the function DailyLoadStim.

## The main code, Masters-Project + DailyLoadStim-

  Takes in user inputs to:<br>
        load specific files,<br>
        set user filtering parameteres,<br>
        set effective peak threshold based on activity,<br>
        coordinate check options,<br>
        range of intensity levels<br>
       
  ## Outputs:
  Peak frequencies, <br>
        histogram of peaks and bins,<br>
        table of stress peaks and bins,<br>
        and intensity table. <br>
        
        
The secondary batch code does almost everything the main code does,<br>
but batches through a main folder and all of the other folders inside it<br>
with a table output of stress peaks and bins.
