# Masters-Project

This project takes tri-axial accelerometer data, collected from I Measure U sensors,
with the end goal to estimate compresive bone force from the function DailyLoadStim.

The main code, Masters-Project + DailyLoadStim-

  Takes in user inputs to:
        load specific files,
        set user filtering parameteres,
        set effective peak threshold based on activity,
        coordinate check options,
        range of intensity levels
       
  Outputs:
        Peak frequencies,
        histogram of peaks and bins,
        table of stress peaks and bins,
        and intensity table. 
        
        
The secondary batch code does almost everything the main code does,
but batches through a main folder and all of the other folders inside it
with a table output of stress peaks and bins.
